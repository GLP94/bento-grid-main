## What I've Learned

* Learned more about grid. I don't know if it is correct, but I do not need template if areas is already defining the disposition of everything.\
* I always used flex to center, but grid + place items/content seems easier to do. I could see it depending on the work.

### What Needs More Work

* I had many difficulties to adapt everything as they should be. I had issues where things were way too big, nothing matched with the example, or just breaking altogether.\
  I need more work with responsive design, especially when dealing with flexbox/grid.
* I tried to give text width to control the overflow, but it resulted in more issues than I would've wanted. I settled with giving the container a max-width, but I need\
  to know better ways to control text overflow, or even element's sizing in general.
